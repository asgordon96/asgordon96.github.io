Computational Chemistry
: I am running [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) simulations to compute the binding
energies of small organic molecules. This includes calculations for the [SAMPL6](https://drugdesigndata.org/about/sampl6)
challenge.

Institute for Systems Biology
: I worked on building a data analysis pipeline for microarray gene expression data. I also developed a web-based pipeline using
python and the framework Flask for the analysis of next-generation microRNA sequencing data. I built a microRNA expression database
with a web interface using MySQL and python. Another project involved applying modern machine learning methods to diagnose sepsis
using gene expression data from blood samples. I also performed statistical analyses using R and python on large gene expression
datasets.

NFL Video Viewer Application (with Kevin Susai)
: Kevin and I developed an application for watching previous NFL games with the ability to view and search the play-by-play log
and click to go to individual plays in the video.

Course Resources Website (in progress)
: A web application that organizes links to useful resources for college-level courses. 

Missile Defense Game
: A simple flash missile defense game inspried by the Atari game [Missile Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command).
You can play it on kongregate [here](http://www.kongregate.com/games/asgordon96/laser-defense).

Flying Game
: A side scrolling flying game I made using coffeescript and the game development framework [phaser](http://phaser.io/).
You can play it [here](http://asgordon96.github.io/flying-game/).

WashU Sports Analytics Club
: I wrote an article on tennis about comebacks from down 2 sets to none. You can read the article at the [WashU Sports
Analytics Club website](http://washusportsanalytics.weebly.com/our-research/tennis-comebacks-from-down-two-sets-by-aaron-gordon).

Flashcards Desktop App
: I created a simple flashcards desktop application using python and the GUI toolkit [wxPython](https://wxpython.org/).
Features include creating, editing, and deleting flashcards, as well as quizzes and quiz statistics. Downloads and the code
are all available at <https://github.com/asgordon96/Flashcards>
