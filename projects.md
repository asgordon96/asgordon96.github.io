Computational Chemistry
: I am running [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) simulations to compute the binding
energies of small organic molecules. 

Institute for Systems Biology
: I worked on building a data analysis pipeline for microarray gene expression data. The goal of another project was to
use machine learning methods to diagnose sepsis using blood gene expression data. 

Missile Defense Game
: A simple flash missile defense game inspried by the Atari game [Missile Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command).

Flashcards Desktop App
: I created a simple flashcards desktop application using python and the GUI toolkit [wxPython](https://wxpython.org/). 
Features include creating, editing, and deleting flashcards, as well as quizzes and quiz statistics. Downloads and the code
are all available at <https://github.com/asgordon96/Flashcards>
