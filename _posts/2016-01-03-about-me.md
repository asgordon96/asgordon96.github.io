title: About Me
---

I am a junior undergraduate computer science major at Washington University in St. Louis. I am particularly interested in
the application of computer science to the physical and life sciences, including bioinformatics and computational chemistry. 
I have worked at the [Institute for Systems Biology](http://www.systemsbiology.org) as a summer research intern and also at the startup 
software company [OneHub](http://www.onehub.com). This fall 2016, I will be working in Jay Ponder's 
[computational chemistry lab](http://dasher.wustl.edu/).
